# SAU-Schedule-Organizer-and-Path-Planner
This project was developed for the Fall 2023 Data Structures and Algorithms course at Southern Arkansas University (SAU) as a group assignment. The main purpose of the project is to help students organize their class schedules and navigate the SAU campus efficiently by finding the shortest paths between buildings.
